# Collecting Data Assignment 4_Corpus collection and processing

## Corpus Analysis with spaCy

*By WANG Shuwei*

The text file came from the dictionary-- txtlab Multilingual Novels authored by Andrew Piper from Figshare which contains 450 novels that appeared between 1770 and 1930 in German, French and English. https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/txtlab_Novel450/2062002/3. I have selected only the English novels from 1800 to 1850. However, due to the file size, I cut a lot of text, and the remaining text is shown in the Text folder in Github.

### The target audience and the intended use of the corpus

Scholars, researchers, or students interested in the analysis of literature and language in the early 19th century, or history buffs or scholars interested in the cultural aspects of that period.
It can be used in language analysis, literary research or historical research

### Text selection criteria

The English novels from 1800 to 1850 which are representative of the cultural trends of the time period or the evolution of the language in the selected time period in future research. However, in this assignment, classic English novels are good examples to practice corpus collection and processing.
